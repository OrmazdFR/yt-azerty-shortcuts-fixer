# YouTube AZERTY shortcuts fixer (yt-azerty-shortcuts-fixer)

## Why this add-on
Because I switched to Firefox from Opera, and the fact that I could not increase the playback rate especially since I could decrease it (same for next/previous frame) annoyed me. Like, REALLY annoyed me.
So I decided to make an add-on to fix this. I know where the problem comes from, but it is my first add-on, so I don't know if it will work.
